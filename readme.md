## Important notes for SQL
#### In SQL the data is stored in the form of tables. The type of data remains same in a column of a table. Like for example, all the column values are a float.
#### Some data types are
1. varchar: represented as varchar(max_character_length)
2. int


## Basic SQL queries 

1. To show all the databases use:
    <div align="center">
    <h2>SHOW DATABASES;</h2>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
    <h3># Do not forget the semicolon</h3>
    </div>
