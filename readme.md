## Important notes for SQL
#### In SQL, the data is stored in the form of tables. The type of data remains same in a column of a table. Like for example, all the column values are a float Some data types are
1. varchar: represented as varchar(max_character_length)
2. int

#### SQL is a relational database, I believe that it basically means that a schema is hidden within the database.

## Basic SQL queries 

1. To show all the databases use:
    <div align="center">
    <h3>SHOW DATABASES;</h3>
    </div>
    
2. To use a databases:
    <div align="center">
    <h3>USE database_name;</h3>
    </div>

3. To use know which database we are in, use:
    <div align="center">
    <h3>SELECT DATABASE;</h3>
    </div>

4. To delete a database, use:
    <div align="center">
    <h3>DROP DATABASE;</h3>
    </div>

5. Adding a table to a dataframe, use:
    <div align="center">
    <h3>CREATE TABLE (name varchar(100), surname varchar(100));</h3>
    </div>
